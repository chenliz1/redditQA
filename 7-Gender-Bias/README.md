### Parallel Observation

- AskMen - AskWomen = The_Donald - ?:

('result by LSA on words: ', None) // not enough data

('result by LSA on authors, by finding overlap commenters: ', [('TwoXChromosomes', 0.84992945), ('The_Donald', 0.83091414), ('Mr_Trump', 0.81460053), ('relationships', 0.79511297), ('Le_Pen', 0.79031277), ('WomenForTrump', 0.78302443), ('AskWomen', 0.78073138), ('BannedFromThe_Donald', 0.7796765), ('HillaryForPrison', 0.77704298), ('TrollXChromosomes', 0.77690208)])

### Gender Bias

- why de-bias the gender difference from word embedding?

in web search, matching(such as resume matching), for example, a technology page, same context information with Bob may be ranked higher(thought more relevant) than the one with Mary.
